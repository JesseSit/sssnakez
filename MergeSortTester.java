  class MergeSortTester

  ALGORITHM:
   First, the unsorted array is split in half until there's only one element in each of 
  resulting arrays. So given an array with 4 elements, those 4 get split into two arrays
  with 2 elements each, and each of those length 2 arrays get split into two arrays with
  1 element each. In that case, there are four 1 element arrays. This guarantees sortedness
  in each of the one element arrays. Now, each of those one element arrays are merged with 
  the other one element array with which they were originally split, and the forming array
  is merged with the other same-length array with which it was originally split, until 
  there is one sorted array that is the length of the original unsorted array.x

  BIG-OH CLASSIFICATION OF ALGORITHM:
  O(nlog(n))

  Mean execution times for dataset of size n:
  Batch size: 100000
  Maximum Random Number: 100000
  n=1       time: 1.10E-08 seconds
  n=10      time: 5.10E-07 seconds
  n=100     time: 5.28E-06 seconds
  ...
  n=100000  time: 0.00950558 seconds

    /******************************
     * execution time analysis 
    Our algo runs 100000 tests per randomly generated array sizes of 1,10, 100, and 100000. 
	For each, the mean of the 100000 tests is calculated for an average execution time.
	Method averageTestTime runs runTest 100000 times, which first generates a randomly-populated
	array of a specified size and then starts timing the MergeSort. Once the array is sorted, the
	total time is found by calculating the difference between the end and start time. Then the time
	for the 100000 tests is averaged.
